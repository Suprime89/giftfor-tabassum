          <h2>When Our Fates Intertwined ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®</h2>

       <p>The first time I saw Tabassum, the world around me slowed down. It was the 8th of September 2022, a regular day that turned into the most significant moment of my life. Behind the library building, where the hustle of college life faded into silence, she stood there, unaware that her presence had already changed me forever.

        She wasn‚Äôt just a girl; she was poetry in motion. The sunlight played in her hair as the gentle breeze moved through the strands. She had a certain grace, a quiet aura that drew me in like gravity. When she turned to look at me, our eyes met for the first time. It was brief, but in that single moment, I felt something shift inside me.
        
        We exchanged a few words‚Äînothing grand, nothing extraordinary‚Äîbut for me, it was the beginning of something magical. I had no idea then that this girl would become the most important part of my life. That meeting behind the library was destiny‚Äôs way of setting our story in motion. üíñ</p>

          <h2>The Beginning of Love ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®</h2>
          <p>
            Only three days had passed since our first encounter, but my heart had already surrendered. On the 8th of September, something beautiful happened‚ÄîI realized I loved her.

It wasn‚Äôt planned. Love never is. It crept up on me, softly, quietly, until I could no longer ignore its presence. Every time I saw her, my heart raced. Every conversation, every shared moment, felt too precious to be ordinary.

That day, as we sat together under the same tree near the library, something felt different. She laughed at something I said, and that laugh‚Äîit was the sweetest melody I had ever heard. I wanted to be the reason for that laughter forever.

That was the day we crossed the invisible line between friendship and something far deeper. That was the day I fell in love with Tabassum. üíï

          <h2>A Love That Grew in Shadows ‚ú®üíñ</h2>
          <p>
            College became our secret paradise. Amid lectures, assignments, and crowded hallways, we found our little moments of magic. Love doesn‚Äôt need grand gestures‚Äîit lives in the small things.

The way we stole glances at each other after the class, the way my day felt incomplete if I didn‚Äôt see her, the way a simple touch of her fingers sent shivers down my spine‚Äîthese moments built the foundation of our love.

We had our secret places‚Äîbehind the library, near the empty corridors, under the tree where we first sat together. It was in those hidden corners that our love flourished.

I remember the first time she held my hand. It wasn‚Äôt planned. It was natural, as if our hands had always belonged together. That simple touch ignited something within me‚Äîan assurance that she was mine, and I was hers.

Those days were the happiest of my life. And even though I didn‚Äôt realize it then, I knew deep down that I wanted this love to last forever. ‚ú®üíñ

          <h2>Holding On to Each Other üí´‚ú®</h2>
          <p>
            A year ago, life took me away from college. The moment I stepped out of those gates for the last time, I felt an ache deep in my chest. I was leaving behind not just a place but the memories, the love, the stolen moments that had become my world.üíñ

But love isn‚Äôt bound by distance. No matter how far we were, our hearts remained connected. We met whenever we could, and every meeting felt more precious than the last. We learned to cherish even the smallest of moments‚Äîa five-minute call, a good morning text, a late-night voice note.üíñ
And when we met after weeks of separation, the way she hugged me‚Äîtight, desperate, as if she never wanted to let go‚Äîwas enough to remind me that no amount of distance could weaken our bond.üíñ

          <p>
            Every moment with her felt like a dream. And when we weren‚Äôt together, my dreams became the place where we met.

Her touch was like an ocean of love‚Äîendless, deep, and overwhelming. When she rested her head on my chest, when our fingers intertwined, when she whispered my name in the silence of the night‚Äîit was beyond words, beyond explanation.

There were nights when we lay beside each other, our bodies close, our breaths mingling. In those moments, time ceased to exist. The world outside faded away, leaving only us, wrapped in the warmth of our love.

Even when she wasn‚Äôt with me, I saw her in my dreams. She was always there, smiling, reaching out to me, pulling me into her embrace. And when I woke up, longing for her touch, all I needed was a single message from her‚Äî‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù That was enough to keep me going. üíï

            We are not just lovers. We are something more. In each other‚Äôs arms, we found a home.

The way she cared for me, the way we spent time together‚Äîit was more than just love; it was a life we had already begun building together.

There were days when we spent time together like husband and wife eating side by side, resting in each other‚Äôs arms after a long day. We didn‚Äôt need a marriage certificate to prove our bond; we had something far greater‚Äîa connection that defied every definition. ‚ú®

            There are moments in life that don‚Äôt just pass‚Äîthey stay with you, carved into your soul. Every time I held her, time seemed to pause, as if the universe itself wanted us to exist in that moment forever.

When she lay beside me, her warmth pressed against mine, I felt more than love‚ÄîI felt complete. Her breath against my skin, her fingers tracing soft patterns on my chest, and the way she fit perfectly in my arms made me believe we were made for each other.

I remember the way she would look into my eyes before leaning in, her lips brushing against mine so gently, yet sending waves of desire through my entire being. Every kiss felt like a silent confession, a thousand emotions poured into one touch. The way she held me, how she‚Äôd bury her face into my neck, whispering my name‚Äîit was everything I ever needed.

            Distance tested our love, but words kept us connected. Every morning, I woke up craving her messages, and when I saw Good morning, my heart melted. Even a simple lovely message carried enough warmth to make my day.
Nights will be special. when We‚Äôd whisper on calls, creating a world where distance didn‚Äôt exist. Close your eyes and feel me there, I will say, and suddenly, She could almost feel her resting on my chest.
Her voice notes were my comfort, her laughter my favorite melody. Even when we were apart, she was always with me.
And when she texted "I love you", it isn‚Äôt just a phrase‚Äîit is a lifeline.

            A kiss is more than just lips meeting; it‚Äôs a silent confession of love. Our first kiss was filled with hesitation, yet when it happened, it felt like the world disappeared.

From then on, every kiss had a meaning. Some were soft and tender, like a slow love song. Others were passionate, driven by the longing of our time apart. But each kiss left me breathless, reminding me she was mine.

One night, as we lay close, she kissed my forehead. It was a simple yet powerful gesture‚Äîmore than passion, it was love, comfort, and home.

Even now, when she‚Äôs not beside me, I close my eyes and feel her lips on mine. And in that moment, distance fades, and love takes over. üíï‚ú®

          <p>February 12, 2025, was the day everything changed‚ÄîI placed my world on her finger. Our love had always felt eternal, but now, it had a promise attached to it.
            I still remember the way her eyes sparkled. She smiled, a little teary, and whispered in her mind, "I‚Äôm yours, forever". It wasn‚Äôt just an regular engagement; it was a commitment, a bond unbreakable by time or distance.
            Though I had left college a year ago, we never let anything weaken our love. We met whenever we could, cherishing every moment like it was our last. We spent time together, not as just lovers, but as soulmates who already belonged to each other.
            Some nights, I would dream of her beside me‚Äîher touch, her warmth, her presence. And when I woke up, reality felt empty without her. All I needed was her I love you and a kiss that could erase every pain of distance.
            Now, we are engaged. The next step is our forever, and I know one thing for sure‚Äîour love story is just beginning. üíñüíï </p>
